MP3NetRandPlayConsole processes all MP3 files under the supplied path
(including all folders and subfolders). If a file name is provided as
the input argument, the folder for that file is used to find the MP3
files. You can set your default MP3 player to MP3NetRandPlayConsole
by right clicking an MP3 file, and click the Change button next to
"Opens with", then browse to the EXE. The console window will open
automatically and close when all the MP3s under the folder have
played. MP3NetRandPlayConsole does not play one MP3 file; it plays all
the MP3s under a folder. MP3NetRandPlayConsole uses the console window
(no forms or custom windows).

This Help is for the RELEASE mode EXE of MP3NetRandPlayConsole. This EXE
plays the audio from each MP3 file under the folder path. The MP3s are
played in random order, with exceptions as noted below, and displays
selected MP3 informational tags.

You would think that Windows Media Player in shuffle mode would be a
better choice, wouldn't you? My experience is that when I loaded a lot
of MP3s from a lot of folders (one folder per CD), WMP did not do a
good job of randomly selecting songs and I kept hearing a few artists
over and over. The freeware "A Random Music Player" skipped a lot of
my MP3 files due to a software issues desribed in the DEBUG help.
MP3NetRandPlayConsole fixes these issues, but only on the console.

If your folder name has blank spaces or special characters, put quotes
around the folder name, e.g.:
MP3NetRandPlayConsole "C:\Gary's Folder"

For troubleshooting information or implementation details, view the HELP
information from the DEBUG mode EXE. In particular, if you have an MP3
file that MP3NetRandPlayConsole won't play, there are some suggestions
in the DEBUG mode help's troubleshooting section.

When MP3NetRandPlayConsole is started with a valid folder containing
MP3 files, the count is displayed and then the songs play.
Information about the song is displayed along with the elapsed time of
the playback. For example:

C:\Release>MP3NetRandPlayConsole.exe C:\cd-music\Rock-Blues\
537 MP3 files, playing in random order.

21:05:21 1/537 C:\cd-music\Rock-Blues\The Runaways\The Best of the Runaways 1987\10 Wasted.mp3
Ctrl-C to skip current MP3. Ctrl-C five times quickly to exit program.
Title: Wasted
Artist: The Runaways
Album: The Best of the Runaways
Year: 1987
Duration: 00:03:25
Elapsed: 00:01:23

In the example above, 21:05:21 is the current time.
1/537 says it is the first of 537 songs to be played.
If there are more than 25 MP3 files, they will be played in random order.
If 25 or fewer, the files will be played in order. There is no way to
adjust this setting. If you want specific files to play, put the files
in their own folder.
The file name of the current song is displayed.
While a song is playing, hit Ctrl-C to skip to the next random song. If
Ctrl-C is clicked five times withint one minute, the program will end.
If five files are skipped within one minute, the program will end.

While playing in random order, MP3NetRandPlayConsole remembers the
artist of the previous song. If the next song randomly has the same
artist, that next song will be skipped. After that, the process
resets, so the NEXT song in random order will always play, even if it
has the same artist of the one that was skipped.

To clarify, if you curate a party mix with a set of 100 MP3s,
MP3NetRandPlayConsole will play them in random order and you can't
change that. If you have a lot of Taylor Swift MP3s in your mix, the
odds of skipping a song will be high in order to avoid flooding your
party with the same artist over and over.

The song information comes from "tags" on the MP3 file. These tags are
standardized, so the Duration tag contains the lenght of the song in
hours, minutes and seconds. However, MP3 tags are usually optional,
so if an MP3 file has no value for a tag, MP3NetRandPlayConsole will
play the MP3 but it won't show a value for the tag. You can use a free
program like Mp3Tag to set the values.
